This repository has some personal arduino-related projects.
I mainly focus on IoT based apps, and I the framework i chosed for this applications is NodeMCU with ESP8266 chip for cheap and introductory home automation projects.

## Arduino Projects

### Voice Analysis using Machine Learning.
I intend in the future to develope some code for voice analysis using machine learning tools in python and an spectrometer made up with an Arduino Mega. This project is based on the Ariev'... project and it focuses on distinguish a voice based on the armonics and subarmonics that our voice emits.
This will be developed in the future.

### Home automation projects
Usually the DIY framework leads to slow but solid growth followed by in depth applications in the related field you worked earlier.
With the IoT industry growing 14% annually acording to Oliver Wymann, understanding this applications and protocols means high value in short-mid tearm.
Homeautomation.io gives full access to learning material to develop a MQTT based home automation platform. MQTT is a lightweight protocol on top of TCP/IP that is used to IoT apps and Homeautomation can be deployed using this language. This project focuses on building a centralize free and fast home monitoring platform using ESP8266 and MQTT with homeautomation.io

## Raspberry Projects
Currently i do not have any raspberry project in mind.
